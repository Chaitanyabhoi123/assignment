    "\n",
    "13. what are the benefits of using python?\n",
    "Answer- Python is a high-level dynamic programming language interpreted and focuses on code readability. There are fewer steps compared to Java and C. In 1991, it was founded by Guido Van Rossum, a developer. Python is one of the most popular and rapidly growing programming languages. Python is a programming language that is powerful, adaptable, and easy to learn. Python also has a vibrant community. Because it supports a wide range of programming paradigms, it is widely found in various businesses. It also automatically manages memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Benefits of Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple to Use and Understand:-\n",
    "\n",
    "For newcomers, Python is simple to understand and use. It's a highly developed programming language with an English-like syntax. The language is simple to adapt as a result of these factors. Because of its simplicity, Python's fundamentals can be implemented faster than those in other programming languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Free and Open-Source:-\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is distributed under an open-source license approved by the Open-Source Initiative (OSI). As a result, users can work on it and distribute it. Users can download the source code, modify it, and even distribute their Python version. Companies that wish to modify a specific behavior and build their version will benefit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Productivity has Increased:-\n",
    "\n",
    "Users can create new kinds of applications using the Python programming language. Because of its versatility, this language permits the operator to try new things. Because of the language, the user is not prevented from trying something new. Python is favored in these scenarios since other programming languages lack the flexibility and freedom that Python does.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpreted Language:-\n",
    "\n",
    "It is an interpreted language, implying that the code is implemented line by line. This is one of the features that makes it simple to use. In the event of an error, it halts the process and reports the problem. Python only shows one error, even if the program has multiple errors. This makes debugging easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Extensive library:-\n",
    "\n",
    "Python includes a huge number of libraries that the user can use. The standard library in Python is immense, and it includes almost every function imaginable. Large and supportive communities, as well as corporate sponsorship, have contributed to this. When working with Python, users do not need to use external libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamically Typed:-\n",
    "\n",
    "Until we run the program, Python has no idea what kinds of parameter we're talking about. It allocates the data type automatically during execution. Variables and their data types do not need to be declared by the programmer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Portability:-\n",
    "\n",
    "Many other languages, including C/C++, demand that user must change their code to run on different platforms. Python, on the contrary, is not equivalent to other programming languages. It only needs to be written once, and then it can be run anywhere. However, the user should avoid involving any system-dependent features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Supportive community:-\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a programming language generated many years ago and has a large community that can assist programmers of all experience levels, from rookies to specialists. Python's community has helped it grow quickly in comparison to other languages. The Python programming language comes with many guides, instructional videos, and highly understandable documentation to help developers learn the language faster and more effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. how is memory managed in python?\n",
    "Answer:- Python uses the dynamic memory allocation which is managed by the Heap data structure. Memory Heap holds the objects and other data structures that will be used in the program. Python memory manager manages the allocation or de-allocation of the heap memory space through the API functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "15. how to install python on windows and set path variable?\n",
    "Answer- (1) Go to the official Python download page for Windows. \n",
    "(2) Find a stable Python 3 release. This tutorial was tested with Python version 3.10.10.\n",
    "(3) Click the appropriate link for your system to download the executable file: Windows installer (64-bit) or Windows installer (32-bit).\n",
    "(4) After the installer is downloaded, double-click the .exe file, for example python-3.10.10-amd64.exe, to run the Python installer.\n",
    "(5) Select the Install launcher for all users checkbox, which enables all users of the computer to access the Python launcher application.\n",

    "python --version\n",
    "\n",
    "16. Is indentation required in python?\n",
    "Answer- Yes, Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:- \n",
    "\n",
    "With indentation-\n",
    "if 5 > 2:\n",
    "  print(\"Five is greater than two!\")\n",
